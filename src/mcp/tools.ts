  description: `Store memories that persist across conversations. Use after making decisions or learning something worth remembering.

RULES:
- 1 concept per memory, 1-3 sentences (20-75 words)
- Self-contained with explicit subjects (no "it", "this", "the project")
- Include dates/versions when relevant
- Be concrete, not vague

MEMORY TYPES (use as metadata.type):
- decision: what was chosen + why ("Chose libSQL over PostgreSQL for vector support and simpler deployment")
- implementation: what was built + where + patterns used
- insight: learning + why it matters
- blocker: problem encountered + resolution
- next-step: TODO item + suggested approach
- context: background info + constraints

DON'T STORE: machine-specific paths, local env details, ephemeral states, pleasantries

GOOD: "Aerion chose libSQL over PostgreSQL for Resonance (Dec 2024) because of native vector support and simpler deployment."
BAD: "Uses SQLite" (no context, no subject, no reasoning)

MANDATORY TRIGGERS (you MUST search when):
- User-Specific Calibration: Answer would be better with user's tools, past decisions, or preferences
- Referential Ambiguity: User says "the project," "that bug," "last time," "as we discussed"
- Decision Validation: Before making architectural or tool choices
- Problem Solving: Before suggesting solutions (check if solved before)
- Session Start: When returning to a project or starting new conversation

INTENTS:
- continuity: Resume work, "where were we" (favors recent)
- fact_check: Verify decisions, specs (favors relevance)
- frequent: Common patterns, preferences (favors utility)
- associative: Brainstorm, find connections (high relevance + mild jitter)
- explore: Stuck/creative mode (balanced + high jitter)
